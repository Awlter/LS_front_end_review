The [JavaScript documentation on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is an amazing reference for JavaScript. MDN is best when you know you want to research a specific topic. The best way to find it is to include "MDN" in your Google search, such as `MDN String` or `MDN Object`.

If you want even more detail than you can find on MDN, just use Google again. For example, to learn how to work with random numbers, try searching for `JavaScript random number`. Adding `JavaScript` to your search helps restrict the results to pages relevant to JavaScript. You may also search for something more specific, such as `JavaScript how to tell whether a variable is defined`.
