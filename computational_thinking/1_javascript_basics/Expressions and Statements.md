# Expressions and Statements

Unlike expressions, statements in JavaScript don't necessarily resolve to a value. Statements generally control the execution of the program. For example, variable assignments are expressions, but variable declarations are statements



There are other types of statements, such as `if ... else ...` and `switch` for branching logic (conditionals), `while` and `for` for looping, etc. We'll learn more about those in the next topics. Just remember that statements help to "do something", instead of giving you a value to use.
