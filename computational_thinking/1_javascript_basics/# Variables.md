# Variables

Guidelines in naming variables:

- JavaScript is case-sensitive; `my_variable` is not the same as `my_Variable`.
- Variable names can be of any length.
- It must start with a Unicode letter, an underscore (`_`), or a dollar sign (`$`).
- Succeeding characters must be Unicode letters, numbers, or underscores.
- It must not be a [reserved word](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-7.6.1).
