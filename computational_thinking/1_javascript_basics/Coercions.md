# Coercions

We sometimes want to convert primitive JavaScript values into values of different types. For example, we may want to convert the string `'345'` into the number `345`. We call such operations **coercions** or **conversions**. However, you may recall that JavaScript primitives are immutable values: JavaScript doesn't actually convert values. Instead, it returns a new value of the proper type.



Explicit:

- Number()
- String(), toString()
- Boolean
